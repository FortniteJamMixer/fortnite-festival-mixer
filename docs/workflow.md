# Development Workflow (v3.0)

This project follows a doc-driven, feature-branch-based workflow.

- All features begin with a design doc in /docs
- No work is done directly on main
- Each feature uses one branch and one squash merge
- LLMs are used for planning, code suggestions, and review only
- Git control remains manual and explicit
